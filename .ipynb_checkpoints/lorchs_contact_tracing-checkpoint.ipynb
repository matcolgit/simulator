    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The contact tracing measures of the article can be divided in two groups: the basic contact tracing (where the contacts of a positive individual to be isolated or tested are randomly selected between all the contacts of the individual, all with same priority) and the advanced contact tracing (where the contacts of a positive individual to be isolated or tested first are selected based on an approximation of their probability of having been infected).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The testing queue has two possible policies (where lower priority = tested first): first in first out, where all individuals to be tested have priority equal to the time they apply, or exposure-risk, where the symptomatic individuals are always tested first (with fifo ordering), then the contact traced household members of a positive individual (with same priority), then the contact tracing selected contacts of a positive individual (with equal priority or priority based on their probability of not being infected in case of basic contact tracing and advanced contact tracing respectively).\n",
    "\n",
    "When an individual is tested positive, the contact tracing starts. Note that the individual is isolated during the contact tracing, so while he is waiting to be tested and waiting for the result of the test he is not isolated.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two components of contact tracing: manual and digital, and each individual can partipate in these measures or not. The digital contact tracing can also be implemented in two ways: either through a P2P app or through a bluetooth beacon based app.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contact between the infector i and the potential infected j is considered valid for contact tracing if it is part of one of four possible situations; an example of each is reported below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) i and j are both at a bus stop at the same time and they both have the P2P tracking app, or both have the beacon based tracking app and the bus stop has a beacon;\n",
    "\n",
    "2) i is compliant with manual tracing and recalls a visit to the office (site_type == 'office'), and j was at the office at the same time and is manually reachable;\n",
    "\n",
    "3) i is compliant with manual tracing and recalls a visit to the supermarket, and j has the beacon based tracking app and the supermarket has a beacon. Note that in this case if j doesn't have the app, he can't be manually reachable because the supermarket has site_type == 'supermarket';\n",
    "\n",
    "4) i and j are both at a bar (site_type == 'social') at the same time and i has the beacon based tracking app, while j is is manually reachable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The valid contacts to be isolated and/or tested are selected in different ways between the basic and advanced contact tracing. The isolation measures applied are isolation from the outside, isolation within the house from the other members of the household, and if the individual becomes symptomatic during the isolation period, he remains isolated until the symptoms disapper.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the basic contact tracing case, the contacts to be isolated and/or tested are selected randomly between all the valid contacts (in case the numeber of contacts to be traced is less than the total number of contacts) and, if they have to be tested, they are added to the testing queue, all with the same priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the advanced contact tracing case, the contacts to be isolated and/or tested are selected based on their empirical probability of being infected (either selecting the individuals with higher probability or all the individuals with probability above a certain threshold) and, if they have to be tested, they are added to the testing queue with priority equal to their probability of not being infected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The members of the same household of the infector are always considered valid contacts and are always selected for the contact tracing measures."

    "### Potential issues\n",
    "\n",
    "* In `__tracing_policy_advanced`, the contacts selected are random instead of being selected based on their empirical survival probability, since there is an additional line that redifines the variable `p`;\n",
    "* when checking if an individual is isolated due to some measure through the function `is_contained` (either directly or through `is_person_home_from_visit_due_to_measure`), the individual results not isolated if he is in the state `'nega'`. This could result in individuals that should be isolated due to some recent measures and are not because they have tested negative in the last test, which could be very old and no longer relevant;\n",
    "* there seems to be a difference of a factor $\\gamma$ between the formula for the empirical probability of exposure in the paper and its implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "A minor downside of the actual implementation is also the fact that a symptomatic individual is not isolated while he is waiting to be tested and while he is waiting for the result of the test.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### *** UPDATE ***\n",
    "The symptomatic individuals are isolated (from the external contacts and within the household) when they are tested positive, since the measures `SocialDistancingForPositiveMeasure` and `SocialDistancingForPositiveMeasureHousehold` are added to the measures list in `experiment.py`."
